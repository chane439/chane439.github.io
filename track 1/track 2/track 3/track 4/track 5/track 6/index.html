    BITTER- <br/> SWEET <br/> GOODBY
  </div>
<div class="leftalign subhead">
  bittersweet, I hate that word <br/>
  it makes me sad, its so absurd <br/>
  for when its time to sink or swim <br/>
  I always drown from missing him <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  good-bys are bittersweet, he’d said <br/>
  and left me lonely in my bed <br/>
  he wasn’t where he’d meant to be <br/>
  I’d beckoned him to come to me <br/>
  and as the sun began to rise <br/>
  he fled so there would be no lies <br/>
  and vanished…right before my eyes <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  then Silence, that I fear, begins <br/>
  I try to call, an endless ring <br/>
  I want to talk but always cry <br/>
  my anger is in fact a lie <br/>
  outside his door, I can’t come in <br/>
  I fall apart…the Silence wins

  his good-by is Bittersweet, I know <br/>
  it follows me, however slow <br/>
  and creeps upon the love I feel <br/>
  biting gently at my heels <br/>
  fearing grief, I try to run <br/>
  knowing soon the end will come <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I hate good-bys, I hate the end <br/>
  I hate to let the sadness in <br/>
  It makes me just a little girl <br/>
  who clings too tightly to her pearls <br/>
  if I let go, my heart won’t beat <br/>
  from missing him, I’ll never sleep <br/>
  but here it comes, however slow <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  his Bittersweet good-by….I know <br/>
